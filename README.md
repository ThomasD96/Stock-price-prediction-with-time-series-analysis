# Stock-price-prediction-with-time-series-analysis

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to do analysis on stock price, and make future prediction based on various time-series algorithm.

In his famous [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/900892.A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=orAUTL55ZJ&rank=1), Burton G. Malkiel said that trying to predict future stock price purely by readings its historical patterns (technical analysis) is no better than tossing a coin. I'm curious, so I applied time-series analysis and machine learning to do exactly that. My conclusion? He is god damn right. The up and down of the market is so random, that the best a model can do is predicting the general trends. Yet, the algorithm tried here might be useful if applied to a less random and actually making-sense data.
